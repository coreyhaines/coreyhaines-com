    <p>Hi, I'm Corey Haines. That's me in the picture.</p>
    <p>I've been writing code since I was very young, probably starting around
    10 or 11. When I was younger, I played a lot of games, and, back then, the
    source code all in BASIC, so we had access to it. When I couldn't figure
    out how to get past a part of the game, I started reading the code to
    figure out what I supposd to do. This gave me an introduction to writing
    programs.</p>
    <p>When I was 15, I started learning C, the moved on to C++, using the
    most excellent Turbo C++ 1.0. I remember being really excited, because it
    was the first MDI-style editor that I had seen (previously, I had been
    using TurboC). I would spend a lot of time in my room writing
    programs.</p>
    <p>Through my teen years and early 20's, I wrote a lot of code in various
    forms, usually small applications for myself in C++. When I was 24, I got
    a job as a web developer doing ASP (actually, I used the pre-ASP microsoft
    web technology, but I prefer to forget about that). At 25, I moved into a
    job writing applications in Visual Basic. That was the beginnig of my
    career, and I haven't really looked back.</p>
    <p>In 2002, I started doing C#. In 2004, I was lucky enough to be involved
    in an Extreme Programming (XP) immersion training with Object Mentor,
    having the opportunity to learn from Bob Martin (Uncle Bob), Lowell
    Lindstrom and Bob Koss (Dr. Bob). At that point, my whole approach to
    programming changed, and, as XP tends to do, it started to affect my whole
    life, as well.</p>
    <p>From 2004 until 2008, I actively searched to improve my development
    skills, focusing on incremental design, pair-programming and test-driven
    development.</p>
    <p>In 2008, I switched from doing C# full-time to Ruby on Rails full-time.
    This was a major change in my life, as it opened up a whole new world of
    possibilities with my development.</p>
    <p>In September of 2008, I lost my job, and I found that I had somehow
    stashed away a few months worth of savings. This allowed me to take a step
    back from the day-to-day grind and look at what I might want to do with my
    life. That's when I decided to finally go on my pair-programming tour.</p>
    <p>In December, 2008, I set out on the road, spend 3 weeks on the road,
    pair-programming with different people in exchange for room and board. It
    was on this initial trip that I attended the Chicago Software
    Craftsmanship Summit. This was a gathering of like-minded people looking
    to establish a sense of craftsmanship and professionalism in the software
    industry. The goal of the summit was to craft a Software Craftsmanship
    Manifesto. While we came away from the meeting with a draft of sorts, it
    took a bit more discussion on the mailing list before Doug Bradbury wrote
    what has now become the official Software Craftsmanship Manifesto.</p>
    <p>Since then, the movement has continued to spread, and I have done my
    part to actively promote the ideals and message of Software Craftsmanship:
    professionalism in both career-development and skills-development.</p>
    <p>I've spent my time this year traveling around, pair-programming in exchange for room and board, as well as talking at conferences (such as Philadephia Emerging Technology and Romanian Open Agile) about Software Craftsmanship.</p>
